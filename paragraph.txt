My name is Smith Budhathoki and I am currently a student in my 4th semester.
My student ID is 200562472 and I am studying CMPG, which I find very interesting and challenging.
I enjoy learning about computers, programming, and how technology can solve real-world problems.
Outside of academics, I love spending time with friends and exploring new places.
Music and movies are a big part of my free time, and I enjoy both relaxing and staying active.
I also like to learn new skills online and improve myself both personally and professionally.
